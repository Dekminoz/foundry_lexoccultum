# Alien RPG System

An UNOFFICIAL system for playing Alien RPG on Foundry VTT.

This system only provides support for character, creature, items, system, talent and character sheets.

There is no game content or images in this system.

Should you wish to populate the system with game content for your own use please purchase the rules from Free League Publishing: https://frialigan.se/en/games/alien/

My intention is to enable people to play Alien RPG remotely and not to create a fully enabled/automated system. Mother will still need to do some work.  
Please do not ask me to provide content. Buy the system from Free League !

See the Journal Entry "Mother Instructions" for an overview on how the sheets work.

### System Version

This is community created game system to run Alien RPG games on virtual table top platforms.
